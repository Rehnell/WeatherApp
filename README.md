# WeatherApp

I have created this weather app from scratch  using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You are able to type in a city worldwide, and it will tell you the current weather of that city and the weather for every 3 hours within 9 hours ahead.


HTML: 

Within the HTML file I used a boiler template ensuring I added a title, CSS stylesheet, JavaScript links, meta tags, and an ico image for the browser windows tab. 

Within the body section, I created a container which has inside a h2 heading (The apps title - Rehnell's Weather App), an input section where you will enter the city in a bar before searching. A search bar button where you can search for the weather for the city you entered. 

I then added divs for the weather info, temperature, hourly forecasts and added my JavaScript link ./script.js at the bottom of the body, so my HTML and JavaScript pages link together.  

CSS: 

When creating this project, I wanted to make sure it had the right weather theme, so in CSS I used colours like blue to represent the sky and I wanted to make the app accessible on mobile, laptop, tablet and PC. 

I added Google Fonts from an import option from the Google font page. I then styled the app interface by size and colour.  

To make it accessible for mobile I used media queries to resize to app so it will fit all mobile screen devices. A scrollbar was added so you could see the weather at various times throughout the next 9 hours. 

JAVASCRIPT: 

JavaScript was used to 



OTHER: 

I then created a domain using Github pages to generate a website domain so the app can be accessible on any device.

I thoroughly enjoyed creating this project.
