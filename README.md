# WeatherApp

I have created this weather app from scratch  using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You are able to type in a city worldwide, and it will tell you the current weather of that city and the weather for every 3 hours within 9 hours ahead.


HTML: 

Within the HTML file I used a boiler template ensuring  

CSS: 

When creating this project, I wanted to make sure it had the right weather theme, so in CSS I used colours like blue to represent the sky and I wanted to make the app accessible on mobile, laptop, tablet and PC. 

JAVASCRIPT: 



To make it accessible for mobile I used media queries to resize to app so it will fit all mobile screen devices. A scrollbar was added so you could see the weather at various times throughout the next 9 hours. 

I then created a domain using Github pages to generate a website domain so the app can be accessible on any device.

I thoroughly enjoyed creating this project.
